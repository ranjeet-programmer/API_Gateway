#FRONTEND - MIDDLE-END - BACKEND

### API-GATEWAY = MIDDLE-END

- we need an intermediate layer between the client side and the microservices.

- using this middle end , when client sends request we will be able to make decision that which microservice should actually respond to this request.S

- we can do message validation , response transformation , rate limiting etc;

- we try to prepare an API Gateway that acts as this
  middle end.
